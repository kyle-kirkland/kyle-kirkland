# About me


**kyle-kirkland/kyle-kirkland** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting used to GitHub 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic Game Development in Godot
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any great learning resources for Godot and possibly C#
